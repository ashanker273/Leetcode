BufferedReader is good if you want to read file line by line and process on them.
Itâ€™s good for processing the large file and it supports encoding also.
BufferedReader is synchronized, so read operations on a BufferedReader can safely be done from multiple threads.
BufferedReader default buffer size is 8KB.
