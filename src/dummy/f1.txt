Suppose we have 3 cards identical in form except that both sides of the first card are colored
red, both sides of the second card are colored black, and one side of the third card is colored
red and the other side is colored black. The 3 cards are mixed up in a hat, and 1 card is
randomly selected and put down on the ground. If the upper side of the chosen card is colored
red, what is the probability that the other side is colored black?
